# Data visualization as code
- Charts as code
	- Until now we talked mostly about the concepts – now moving on to creating visualizations 
	- While good no-code tools like Rawgraphs, Datawrapper… exist, they only allow for limited control
	- Tools like Inkscape (or Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer etc.) or Figma allow for full control, but they don’t offer reproducibility and require a lot of manual work 
	- Coding for data visualization is a task of its own 
	- We are working with code, so we want to use loops, variables, functions etc. 
	- But we are also working with graphics and charts, so we need some logic to do this as well
	- Various visualization libraries abstract different parts of this work 
		- You interact with templates 
		- Or with lower-level graphical objects
- How much to abstract?
	- Let the users… 
		- Create coordinate systems and manipulate the graphical elements themselves
		- Create, use and combine multiple templates (most common chart archetypes)
		- Use predefined templates
		- Use complete charts that include underlying necessary data transformations
	- Ease of use vs. customizability 
		- Easier to use = more elements are hidden from the user 
	- Other considerations: 
		- Interactivity, animations etc 
		- Drawing on screen vs exporting visualizations 
		- Performance
		- Lingo (terms, names for concepts etc.)
